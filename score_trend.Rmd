## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an R Markdown document. The purpose of this file is to show case some main functions might use in my final project package. All code block show above is just rough draft. I will keep updating the file as the I continue update my final project package.


## Calculate the total points scored vs total points allowed of all time (function name: overall_trend_by_years)
```{r,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
score_stats = read.csv("oregon_football.csv")

# create a new data frame
overall_trend<- score_stats %>%
  group_by(season)%>%
  summarize(total_score=sum(points_scored),
            total_allowed=sum(points_allowed))


# plot graph by yeas to show points scored and allowed
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = overall_trend, aes(season,total_score),colour= "green")+
  geom_line(data = overall_trend, aes(season,total_allowed),colour= "red")+
  labs(x= "Season",
       y= "Point",
       caption = "Overall Score Trend. Green line represent points scored. Red line represent points allowed")+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10)+
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10)

```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code above will sort all games by season years and show the total points scored and allowed in each season. Then create a plot to visualize the trend. 


## Team vs Team (function: record_by_team)
```{r,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE}

score_stats = read.csv("oregon_football.csv")


by_team<- score_stats %>%
  filter(opponent == "UCLA", season >2000)
  by_team$win_lose <- ifelse(by_team$points_scored > by_team$points_allowed, 'Win',
                           ifelse(by_team$points_scored < by_team$points_allowed, 'Lose','Tie'))


  data.frame(Games = nrow(subset(by_team, opponent == "UCLA")),
             Win = nrow(subset(by_team, win_lose == "Win")),
             Lose = nrow(subset(by_team, win_lose == "Lose")))
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code above can let user enter team and season.The result will show how many games are played after that season and game results.


## Home team season stats (function name: stats_by_season)
```{r,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
  score_stats = read.csv("oregon_football.csv")

  by_years<- score_stats %>%
    filter(season == 2000)

  data.frame(highest_score = max(by_years$points_scored),
             highest_allowed = max(by_years$points_allowed),
             home_average = round(mean(by_years$points_scored),digits = 1),
             opp_average = round(mean(by_years$points_allowed),digits = 1)
             )
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code above will show the home team season stats when user enter particular season. The result include highest score of home team, highest score of opponent team, average score of home team and average score of opponent team.
